As pointed out in the developer guide

scope.resolve method is deprecated. For that reason it was not implemented
in typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint and no-unnecessary-waiting rule
fails with version 4.x of the typescript eslint parser.

The eslint developer guide suggest to use `scope.references.find` instead."

If the user already has a globally-installed Cypress, they may not want one created in their app's `node_modules` folder (particularly if the Rails app is an API-only backend!)

As passing any value to `install_cypress_with` that isn't `yarn` or `npm` skips installation, I've chosen `skip` here. As long as nobody releases a package manager called `skip` this should be fine 😁"

These ivars are normally initialized by `setup_fixtures`, which isn't actually mixed into
cypress-rails, because we're piggy-backing on AR's fixture transaction management
feature, not actually using fixtures. As a result, this was probably never actually working
correctly for applications that spun up >1 connection in their test runs.

However, because we bind the connection pool call to self, this should at least get that
much working, though without a reproducible test case my confidence that this ever
worked as imagined or will start working now is very low. Nevertheless, should clear
the error being experienced without impacting anyone for whom this actually is
working as intended somehow.

Verified these ivars are present thru Rails 6.1.4

Failures in Cypress hooks (before, beforeEach, after and afterEach)
can't be accurately represented in JSON reports, there just isn't AFAIK
a good way to generate such report.

Before and After hooks are now no longer implemented using Cypress'
hooks. This ensures that we can properly generate reports in case of
failures in those.

The new behavor of these hooks are in line with how cucumber-js works,
but *not* how Cypress' hooks work. This surely warrants some
documentation..."

Moves `cypress` from deps to devDeps, allowing users to set the version of Cypress they want to use in their package.json (without having to rely on a Yarn resolution to force the version).

Currently, as `cypress` is a dependency, even setting the version to `7.1.0` for example will still use the latest 6.x version installed by the schematic. With this fix, it should use the version specified in the package.json"

can not be stringified (like bigint).  This in turn protects getCurrentState(),

Also, updated the tests with a bigint to show the failure/test the fix."

In my usage of this plugin, I've come across an issue where cy.react returns an array of empty (null or undefined) value(s). This is happening on a page where the component I'm querying for will not render until a certain threshold of data is loaded into the application. The behavior I expect is that cy.react keeps retrying until the element renders (or until timeout), but in practice, I find that it doesn't retry once, but it immediately returns an array of `undefined`. I suspect that there is an interim state where the component exists in the virtual dom (thus resq can find it), but has not yet been rendered to the dom.

These changes, tested against the application I'm working on, handle this case and allow the plugin to know to retry."

make is clever enough to try several matching rules and use the one with
satisfiable rules. This also only rebuilds changed parts, whereas the
old rule recreated all firmware dependencies unconditionally.

Also split linker LINKFLAGS from compile SDCCFLAGS.

Autovector interrupts should not specify an interrupt number, as these
creates unnecessary entries in the interrupt table, wasting 8 bytes
of direct adressable memory per entry.
The entry for interrupt 13 (which is nonexistant) is used to reserve
enough space for the overlays for interrupt 8 (USB) and 10 (GPIF).

BREAKING CHANGE: any non-nil value does not require to be recomputed

The default value for the `validate` option changed from `false` to `true`, meaning any non-nil value is valid and does not require to be recomputed.

```js
// v1
cy.dataSession(name, setup, true)
// v2
cy.dataSession(name, setup)
```

Same for the option form

```js
// v1
cy.dataSession({
  name,
  setup,
  validate: true,
})
// v2
cy.dataSession({
  name,
  setup,
})
```

If you previously set `validate` to false, keep it the same

```js
// v1, v2
cy.dataSession(name, setup, false)
```"

we need to make sure the lazy event happens. So we scroll down the page
quickly (and then back up).

If a test is automatically retried, happo would duplicate snapshots that
were part of the retry and add a counter suffix to the variant name,
e.g. ""foo-bar-1"".

To fix this, I've made us listen to the after:spec event, then inspect
each test to look for failed attempts. If a failed attempt is found, we
delete all snapshots made during the duration of the failed attempt. I'm
making the assumption that timestamps will be in sync between the
browser process and the background node process. This could be
dangerous, but I couldn't find a better alternative to associate
snapshots with a test attempt.

Because of the added after:snapshot event handler, I'm changing the
initialization process:

happoTask.register(on)

This is a breaking change, so in order to help people upgrading without
updating config, I'm adding an assertion and an error message if we
detect that we haven't registered correctly."

Failures in Cypress hooks (before, beforeEach, after and afterEach)

a good way to generate such report.

Before and After hooks are now no longer implemented using Cypress'
hooks. This ensures that we can properly generate reports in case of
failures in those.

The new behavor of these hooks are in line with how cucumber-js works,
but *not* how Cypress' hooks work. This surely warrants some
documentation..."

The function drains off all the remaining data in the receive socket
and is triggered before starting a capture and after a capture is
completed. In the absence of this function, there is a possibility of
data corruption and also the NodeJS TCP server throws an error if the
buffer is not completely read out before the socket is closed.

BeagleLogic now supports two modes of interface - one being the
native mode running on an ARM system like the BeagleBone Black
and the other mode acting like a TCP client for the BeagleLogic
server running off a BeagleBone compatible system. This makes it
convenient for desktop users to retrieve samples from BeagleLogic,
no more copying files and SSHing into the BeagleBone hardware in
order to use BeagleLogic.

There were some issues when using libftdi 0.x recently that are fixed
when switching to libftdi 1.x (not really worth the effort to investigate).

libftdi 1.x has been around several years now and should be available
in most recent distros and OSes. For the rare cases where it is not,
it's easy enough to get it via backport packages, or build from source,
or sigrok users can just use our binary installers for most OSes.

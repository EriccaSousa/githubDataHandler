make is clever enough to try several matching rules and use the one with
satisfiable rules. This also only rebuilds changed parts, whereas the
old rule recreated all firmware dependencies unconditionally.

Also split linker LINKFLAGS from compile SDCCFLAGS.

These rows in conjunction got me confused for a while:

      # To record on Cypress dashboard we need to set CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY environment variable
      # environment variable BUILD_BUILDNUMBER is a good candidate

As an unexperienced Cypress user, I assumed the RECORD_KEY was supposed to be my BUILDNUMBER.

This is clearly not the case, since the following error will be produced:
> Errors: [ ""data.recordKey must be uuid format"" ]

My change should suffice to clarify that doubt, but I'm sure you as domain experts can improve it as well."

Autovector interrupts should not specify an interrupt number, as these
creates unnecessary entries in the interrupt table, wasting 8 bytes
of direct adressable memory per entry.
The entry for interrupt 13 (which is nonexistant) is used to reserve
enough space for the overlays for interrupt 8 (USB) and 10 (GPIF).

This change adds minimal edits to the Dashboard -> GitLab Integration page to briefly explain pitfalls & additional steps specific to the new GitLab Self-managed integration.

Please note that this change is not ready to be merged as there are outstanding issues to be resolved - whilst we have confirmed the renaming of 'GitLab for Enterprise' to 'GitLab Self-managed', the required Dashboard changes have yet to land & may yet require further changes.

Furthermore, the Dashboard's integration configuration areas are currently undergoing redesign, so consider this a precursor to a more thorough rewrite of the integration docs that will address their existing shortcomings."

https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/commit/338cead0e6c9e75d6535bd761c5adf017b7630eb,"Remove superfluous reference to .cache

Cypress by default caches its binaries to `~/.cache`, but since this can't be cached by GitLab CI the docs suggests to change the cache directory like this: `CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER: ""$CI_PROJECT_DIR/cache/Cypress""`. It then tells you to cache the new cache directory: `- cache/Cypress`. This means that caching `.cache/*` is superfluous."

* Update answer about code coverage

Since linked issue was closed I took the [closing comment](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/346#issuecomment-530967799) and made it the new answer (with minimal wording tweaks suitable in the context of this document).

I left the related resources in, since they still seems to be helpful and related to ""coverage"" in general. But I slightly modified the wording to
- no longer sound like code coverage is not there
- invite more links should anybody have one

* style: Use ""full stack"" instead of ""full-stack""

* Update source/faq/questions/general-questions-faq.md

The example `.spec` uses `.js` as a file-ending which I assume should reflect the use of typescript so I propose the change to `.ts`
Also as far as I understand it would make sense to keep all your configuration files in `.ts` format if you use typescript and the docs suggest otherwise.
Please correct me if I am wrong.

Thank you for your work and best regards
David"

* Added example for serving instrumenting code 

The documentation explains how to setup the babel-plugin-istanbul plugin, but doesn't provide any examples or guidance for how to serve the application with the instrumented code without an intermediate folder, once the plugin is setup. 

I've also separated the Instrumenting code section into the two parts, which should make it easier to read. 

Potential limitation of this specific example is that it assumes the application was build using create-react-app.

On platforms without a decent grep, it seems stop-only does a poor
job of correctly detecting focused tests. There's an eslint plugin
which is much more suitable, use that instead.

While changing eslint config, tidy up the lint commands and fix a
couple of minor issues in files that were not being linted.

Exclude public/ and themes/ folders from lint, cover everything else."

- When link to a header within the same doc, use `urlhash` instead of
`url`.
- When linking to other doc pages, only reference the final document
name, so instead of `guides/references/configuration`, just put
`configuration`

* guides: add details on environment variables in proxy configuration

* Mostly restructured the content

- Have main section be ‘View, unset, and set env vars’ - with OSes as
sub sections
- Only have 1 line per command line (since our styling doesn’t really
accomodate more than 1 line :(
- Remove comments from command line - we want users to be able to
copy/pasta as much as possible and comments in the command line are
inavlid.
- Add h3 headers for easier linking to sub-sub-sections

* guides: add Proxy Configuration to Configuration

* guides: indicate that localhost must be re-added to NO_PROXY

* more in-depth, moved to its own page

* Minor updates

@flotwig
- When link to a header within the same doc, use `urlhash` instead of
`url`.
- When linking to other doc pages, only reference the final document
name, so instead of `guides/references/configuration`, just put
`configuration`

* Add autogenerated changelog

* Write more human readable changeglog

* Add newly closed issue to changelog

* Add new accessibility feature to changelog

* removed docs link feature - after further review I realize this was not part of PR

* guides: add details on environment variables in proxy configuration (#1545)

* guides: add details on environment variables in proxy configuration

* Mostly restructured the content

- Have main section be ‘View, unset, and set env vars’ - with OSes as
sub sections
- Only have 1 line per command line (since our styling doesn’t really
accomodate more than 1 line :(
- Remove comments from command line - we want users to be able to
copy/pasta as much as possible and comments in the command line are
inavlid.
- Add h3 headers for easier linking to sub-sub-sections

Details:
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html#Explicit-Subjects - jQuery map accept callback function with arguments `( Object elementOfArray, Integer indexInArray )` (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/), so it should be `$p.map((el, i) => {` instead of `$p.map((i, el) => {`"

This should be an error when running JavaScript in ES5 ""strict mode,"" because implicit variables in JavaScript become globals.
